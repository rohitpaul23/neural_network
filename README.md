Work with the Poker Hand dataset available on the UCI repository
Each record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of 52. 
Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive attributes. 
There is one Class attribute that describes the Poker Hand.

Implemented a generic neural network architecture to learn a model for multi-class classification using one-hot encoding. 
Implemented the backpropagation algorithm (from first principles) to train the network
